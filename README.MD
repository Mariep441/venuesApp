>Shows detailed information on a movie. Clicking the 'Show Reviews' button will display extracts from critic reviews.

### Routing.

...... Insert a list of the routes supported by your app and state the associated view. If relevant, specify which of the routes require authentication, i.e. protected/private. For projects that expanded the Movies Fan app, only new routes should be listed ......... 

+ /blogs - displays all published blogs.
+ /blogs/:id (private) - detail view of a particular blog.
+ /blogs/:id/comments (private) - detail view of a particular blog and its comments.
+ etc.
+ etc.

## React feature set.

..... Insert a bullet-point list of the React features used in your project, including one source code file references for each - see examples below ......

+ useState and useEffect hooks - src/components/fileA.js
+ useContext hook - src/components/fileb.js
+ Extended Link - src/components/fileA.js
